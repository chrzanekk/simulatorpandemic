This is simple project of pandemic simulation
Idea of this small project came from old interview task
In this project i will try to implement full functional simulator using:
- Spring boot 3.2.2
- Kotlin 1.9.22(Java17)
- Testcontainers
- Postgresql
- Mockk
- Junit
- WebFlux(for testcontainers tests)

In the future, I will add some more information how this simulator will work.
